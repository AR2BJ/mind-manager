# Mind Manager

A modern productivity-oriented planner web app for organizing tasks, managing daily commitments, reviewing activity, and tracking progress through a clean and responsive interface.

## Overview

Mind Manager is a frontend-only application focused on personal planning and daily organization. It gives users a structured way to create and manage plans, review them through a calendar and analytics view, and keep everything accessible without needing a backend service.

All user data is stored locally in the browser using `LocalStorage`, making the app fast, private, and easy to use.

## Key Features

- Organize plans in a structured planner flow
- View activity in a calendar-based overview
- Track performance with analytics and reporting views
- Use autocomplete and combobox-based inputs for faster planning
- Customize theme and app settings
- Import, export, and reset saved data
- Works responsively on desktop and mobile screens
- Store planning data locally for a lightweight personal workflow

## Core Functionalities

### Planner and Plan Management

Users can manage daily plans through a dedicated planner interface with actions for:

- adding new plans
- editing existing entries

### Settings and Theme Control

The app includes configuration options for:

- theme switching
- reset actions
- import/export of saved state
- general personal preference settings

### Auto-Logging and Productivity Support

The app includes productivity-related automation features such as automatic plan logging, helping reduce manual effort when tracking activity and progress.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular frontend design with responsibilities separated into clear layers:

- `app/` — app bootstrap and global theme configuration
- `components/` — UI blocks and feature-specific modules
- `controllers/` — user interactions, event handling, and workflow logic
- `models/` — state and storage definitions
- `services/` — business logic, notifications, store access, and automation
- `views/` — rendering layers for planner, calendar, and analytics
- `utils/` — helper functions and constants

This structure keeps the codebase clean, maintainable, and easier to extend over time.
